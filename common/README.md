# Data Management by Design - Common Architecture Model

Here you can find Architectural Views related to Research Data
Management in a university setting.

The achitectural views presented here are the result of an activity
to establish a common ground for research data management and the
enterprise architecture for implementing it at Danish Universities.

## Common ground

The common ground models the motivation of stakeholders inside and
outside the university that have an interrest in research data
management.

The common ground model is in the file [common.archimate](common.archimate) which must be opened using [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/).

Aternatively you can [view it directly in your browser](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Data-Management-by-Design/DMbD/7998b0bf/common/html/index.html).
