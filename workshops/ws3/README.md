# Data Management by Design - Workshop 3 - Analysing data

Here you can find the materials related to the second workshop of the
'Data Management by Design' activity.

The goal of the workshop was to identify important requirements to the
infrastructure supporting the analysis and publishing of research data in a
university setting. 

The presenentation from the workshop is available as a [PDF](ws3-slides.pdf). 

## Method

A subset of the ArchiMate language is used to model the motivations
and goals of stakeholders having requirements to the handling of
research data at universities.

![Example of the simplified ArchiMate motivation modelling used in the workshop](../ws1/SimpleMotivationExample.svg)

Each workshop participant prepared examples of drivers, requirements
and goals from interviews with researchers in their institution. The
modelling modeling was done as tables in a spreadsheet, like in the second workshop.

At the workshop all participants worked jointly to come up with
drivers, goals and infrastructure requirements. In this third workshop
the participants had become familiar with motivational modelling and
were extreemly productive, and managed to revisit the subject of the
previous worshops.

## Results

The combined tables from the workshop preparation and the workshop can
be found in the [raw-data directory](raw-data). There are sheets for
goals, drivers and infrastructure requirements for different classes
of stakeholders that addresses all parts of the lifecykle of research
data.

The combined results from all workshops have been collected into a
single model in the [common directory](../common).

## Presentation

The presenentation from the workshop is available as a [PDF](ws3-slides.pdf).
