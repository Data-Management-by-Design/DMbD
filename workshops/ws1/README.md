# Data Management by Design - Workshop 1 - Archiving

Here you can find the materials related to the first workshop of the
'Data Management by Design' activity.

The goal of the workshop was to identify important requirements to the
implementation of a **research data archive** in a university setting from
the various stakeholders along with their primary motives.

The presenentation from the workshop is available as a [PDF](ws1-slides.pdf). 

## Method

A subset of the ArchiMate language is used to model the motivations
and goals of stakeholders having requirements to the handling of
research data at universities.
