# Data Management by Design

Here you can find Architectural Views related to Research Data Management in a university setting.

# Research Data Management
Research Data Management (RDM) is a term that has been moving to the forefront of the discourse on digital infrastructures for research. But what exactly do we mean when we call for better research data management? This is not a simple question to answer as anyone who have been in a discussion of the subject will recognize. Improved RDM is touted as central to the solution of problems as diverse and conflicting as:

 - The reproducibility crisis
 - Compliance with privacy laws
 - Data security
 - Preservation of cultural heritage
 - Promoting reuse of research data
 - Protection of intellectual property
 - Promoting open access to data
 - Handling the explosive growth of data resulting from new and ever improving instruments

In 2015 [Danish e-Infrastructure Cooperation (DeiC)](https://www.deic.dk/en ) and [Denmarks Electronic Research Library (DEFF)](https://www.deff.dk/english/) started the National Forum for Research Data Management ([DM-forum]) tasked with developing a common ground for research data management accross the danish universities, research libraries, and preservation institutions. 

Through the activities of the DM Forum its members have achieved insight into the landscape of RDM and its many complexities. Capturing this insight on paper or communicating it to various stakeholders can however be difficult. The problem is that each stakeholder has sepparate viewpoint and set of expectations with regards to RDM.

The Research Data Management by Design activity tried to capture what RDM means in relation to digital infrastructures for research and document the findings as a formal model in the ArchiMate modelling language. Specifically, the goal was to establish the common understanding of what is required of the digital infrastructures for research data to support and improve research data management in a university setting.

# An architectural  model of the motivation for RDM
This model contains motivational viewpoints for varous RDM-stakeholders in a university setting. It is the result of work carried out in the Danish Datamanagement Forum activity Data Management by Design in 2018. Data for the model was collected through a series of [workshops](workshops) with participants representing a wide selection of RDM-stakeholders. 

The full model is available as a printable report in
[PDF](common/exported/common-model.pdf) or 
[HTML](https://raw.githack.com/Data-Management-by-Design/DMbD/master/common/exported/common-model.html) format.
But be aware, that reading through the printed report may not be the best way to experience the model. The imformation is far better presented by loading the [model file](common/common.archimate) into an architecture model browser like [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/).

Aternatively you can [use the dynamic web version directly in your browser](https://raw.githack.com/Data-Management-by-Design/DMbD/master/common/html/index.html).

Notice: During the activity it was deemed most productive to only use a small subset of the ArchiMate modelling language, namely; drivers, goals, stakeholders, and requirements. The modelling of relations has been reduced to only model simple association, and where it is very obvious compositions. The simplified modelleing is carried through to the model.
